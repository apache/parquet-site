# Parquet Website

This website is built / powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and extended from the [Docsy Theme](https://www.docsy.dev/).

The following steps assume that you have `hugo` installed and working.

## Building and Running Locally

Clone this repository to run the website locally:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:apache/parquet-site.git
cd parquet-site
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To build or update your siteâ€™s CSS resources, you also need PostCSS to create the final assets. By default npm installs tools under the directory where you run npm install.

```
npm install -D autoprefixer
npm install -D postcss-cli
npm install -D postcss
```

To run this website site locally, run the following in the root of the directory:

```shell
hugo server
```
