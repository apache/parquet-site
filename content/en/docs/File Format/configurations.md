### Row Group Size

Larger row groups allow for larger column chunks which makes it
possible to do larger sequential IO.  Larger groups also require more buffering in
the write path (or a two pass write).  We recommend large row groups (512MB - 1GB).
Since an entire row group might need to be read, we want it to completely fit on
one HDFS block.  Therefore, HDFS block sizes should also be set to be larger.  An
optimized read setup would be: 1GB row groups, 1GB HDFS block size, 1 HDFS block
per HDFS file.

### Data Page  Size
Data pages should be considered indivisible so smaller data pages
allow for more fine grained reading (e.g. single row lookup).  Larger page sizes
incur less space overhead (less page headers) and potentially less parsing overhead
(processing headers).  Note: for sequential scans, it is not expected to read a page
at a time; this is not the IO chunk.  We recommend 8KB for page sizes.
